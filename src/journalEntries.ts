    content: "Dear Bobkowska , hope you are well. Highlight of the day - i worked out with Vlad, he had a really interesting story to tell. His girlfriend is from Ukraine , they have been together for 5 years now. When the war started , his girlfriend was forced to move to the Netherlands. He said , they don't just allow you to cross border in Ukraine as a male in his early 20s. He crossed the border somewhat unofficially to get to the Netherlands, find a job ,reunite with his girlfriend , pretty romantic - (He just crosses the border , but did he make an app for her ? Jez , loser).He also shared a bunch of great restaurants in Warsaw , that he claimed has really good food. We should go there once in Warsaw. See you tomorrow ðŸ’™",
