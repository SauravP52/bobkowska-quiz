Used AI at work as always. Today we had indian food in the office. They also celebrated my 5 years uberversary. Jez, am i too old for this? Also i signed up for a ADHD test with a therapist on Friday. She's Indian so cheaper and affordable , XD. Also i will be running and going to the gym today(With Vlad), and play some games with Shawn. This app is going to be continually updated with a lot of features , haha you lucky. Hope you don't kill yourself of boredom. Miss you loads ðŸ’™",
